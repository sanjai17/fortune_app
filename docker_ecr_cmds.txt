1. Downloaded the .zip file from the github repo --> https://github.com/wego/devops-fortune-api
2. Copied to my EC2 instance where docker and terraform is already installed through SCP.
Ran the below cmds to generate the docker image and test in local

cd api
docker build -t fortune-api .
docker run -d -p 8080:8080  --name fortune-container fortune-api

3. Ran the below AWS CLI commands to authorize and push the docker images into ECR repository(prior to this i created new repository in ECR.)

  aws ecr get-login-password --region us-east-1 | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 558737725740.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
  docker tag devops:latest 558737725740.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/devops:latest
  docker push 558737725740.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/devops:latest



Once the image was pushed successfully into ECR then we proceed to bring up the ECS cluster using terraform scripts mentioned in the sub-directory --> terraform/*.tf
